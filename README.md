  <h2> <i> What does this project entails? </i> </h2>
<p><i> Recommender system has the ability to predict whether a particular user would prefer an item or not based on the user's profile Recommender systems are beneficial to both service providers and users In this project we are building a recommendation system/model that will recommend us restaurants in a paticular destination taking in your latitude and longitude geographic location.</p>

<br>


  <h2> Details of the Project </h2>

<p>We will be taking in our dataset and train our model according to reviews it has and its location, using KMeans clustering. We will also see how to potray geographical data onto our colab file using plotly libraries(and geopandas) and more. Lastly we will build a basic function that will take geographical data as input and recommend restaurants to the user</p>
  
<br><br>
<h2> <i>Machine Learning Model</i> </h2>
<p><i>So we start off with building a machine learning model using KMeans clustering model and train that model using the dataset For this project you will have to undestand all the libraries used before you start implementing the code</p>
  <br> <br>

 <h2> <i>Types of Recommendation Systems</i> </h2> 
<p><i>There are mainly two types of recommendation system and a hybridof these two types.
  1. Content Based Filtering: It makes recommendations based on user preferences, for product features. <br>
  2. Collaborative Filtering: It mimics user to user recommendations.
